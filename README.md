I doubt this will be of interest to anyone but me, but for the sake of completeness,
here's how you get started:

1. clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. copy `sample.env` to `.env` and fill in your login information and download path
3. run `./download.js` and watch it do it's thing

Then you'll have your current balance (minus pending transactions) in the console, and
a "chase.QFX" file in the download folder you specified.
